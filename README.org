This is the place where I try to solve [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] puzzles in Rust.

I won't save Christmas, but I'll have some fun anyway and I'll teach
myself some Rust.

* Usage

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:nlegrand/my_advent_of_code.git
cd my_advent_of_code
cargo run --bin 2022_day01_puzzle1  
#+end_src
